Test project: Create a trivia quiz using javascript and jQuery.

Newsday will provide a feed of questions and answers.

HYPERLINK http://data.newsday.com/feeds/trivia_test.php

For JSONP, you can add a callback parameter -  HYPERLINK http://data.newsday.com/feeds/trivia_test.php?callback=test

Here's a typical question:

{
	"question2": "What is the Long Island minor league baseball team?",
	"choices":
		[
			{ "id": "1", "text": "Islanders" },
			{ "id": "2", "text": "Dodgers" },
			{ "id": "3", "text": "Ducks" },
			{ "id": "4", "text": "Flames" }
		],
	"correct": "3",
	"otherReaders": "50" //this is supposed to be the running percentage of correct responses from other readers
},

The quiz will have five questions. The questions should display one at a time. It should work something like this -Â 

	Reader shown a question.

	Reader submits response.

	Reader shown the correct answer, a running score for the number of correct answers and the percentage correct answers for other readers. For example, after the third question, it might say "You have answered 2 of 3 correctly for a score of 67%. Among all readers, 55% answered this question correctly."

	Reader clicks link to see the next question.

After you're finished, either send us a link to the working quiz or send us files to deploy on our server.

Please don't hesitate to ask questions if anything needs to be clarified.
